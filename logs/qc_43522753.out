SECTION 6: Aggregation Strategy Comparison
-------------------------------------------
Comparing different aggregation methods...

Available aggregation strategies:
  - sum
  - weighted

Correlation between aggregation strategies (Control):
           sum weighted
sum      1.000    0.997
weighted 0.997    1.000

Correlation between aggregation strategies (Mutant):
           sum weighted
sum      1.000    0.997
weighted 0.997    1.000

Strategy comparison statistics:
  Control sum range:      0.2 - 3322.9
  Control weighted range: 0.0 - 158.6
  Mutant sum range:       0.2 - 21740.1
  Mutant weighted range:  0.0 - 954.4

✓ Main count matrix uses 'sum' aggregation

Strategy Interpretation:
  - 'sum': Simple sum of all 25 pixels in 5×5 buffer
           → Best for detecting ANY signal in buffer region
           → Robust to positional shifts
           → May include more background noise

  - 'weighted': Distance-weighted sum (center pixels weighted higher)
           → Gives more importance to center pixel
           → Balance between precision and shift-tolerance
           → Values typically lower than sum

✓ High correlation between strategies (>0.95)
  → Choice of aggregation method has minimal impact on results
  → Both strategies capture similar biological signal

SECTION 7: Final QC Assessment & Recommendations
=================================================

QC ASSESSMENT:
==============
✓ PASS (with warnings)

Data quality is acceptable, but note the following:
  ⚠ Less than 50% of loops have centered peaks
  ⚠ Low center enrichment (<0.2) suggests diffuse signal

SUMMARY STATISTICS:
===================
Dataset:             22108 loops × 2 samples
Sample correlation:  0.901 (Pearson)
Library size ratio:  1.04 (mut/ctrl)
Mean log2 FC:        -0.066 ± 0.220
Loops with |M|>1:    46 (0.2%)
Positional shifts:   11924 (53.9%)
Center enrichment:   0.074 (ctrl), 0.075 (mut)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
================
1. ✓ Proceed with edgeR differential analysis
2. ✓ Data quality supports biological interpretation
3. ⚠ 53.9% of loops show positional shifts - buffer approach validated

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
→ Run edgeR differential analysis script
→ Compare results with Hiccups differential calls
→ Validate top hits with biological context
