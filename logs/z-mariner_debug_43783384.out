  66 genes were dropped because they have exons located on both strands
  of the same reference sequence or on more than one reference sequence,
  so cannot be represented by a single genomic range.
  Use 'single.strand.genes.only=FALSE' to get all the genes in a
  GRangesList object, or use suppressMessages() to suppress this message.
