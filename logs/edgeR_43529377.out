Setup complete
   - Config loaded from: config/edgeR_config.yaml
   - Output directory:  outputs/edgeR_results 
   - Random seed:  42 

Loading input data...
   - Loading count matrix... (22108 loops × 2 samples)
   - Loading loop coordinates... (22108 genomic positions)
   - Loading QC summary... (shift data for 0 loops)

Validating data integrity...
   ✓ Data integrity checks passed

Creating genomic annotations...
   ✓ Created annotation for 22108 loops
   - Columns: loop_id, chr1, start1, end1, chr2, start2, end2, coord_string

Creating DGEList object...
   ✓ DGEList created
   - Samples: ctrl, mut 
   - Library sizes: ctrl = 10789577 , mut = 10377560 
   - Ratio (ctrl/mut): 1.04
