[DEBUG] Checking shift_status before adding to genes_df...
   - Class of shift_status: NULL 
   - Length of shift_status: 0 
   - Length of genes_df: 22108 
   - Is it NULL? TRUE 
   - Is it a vector? FALSE 

[DEBUG] After adding shift_status to genes_df...
   - Columns in genes_df: loop_id, chr1, start1, end1, chr2, start2, end2, coord_string 
   - Has shift_status column: FALSE 
   âš  WARNING: shift_status column NOT added!
   ✓ Created annotation for 22108 loops
   - Columns: loop_id, chr1, start1, end1, chr2, start2, end2, coord_string 
   - Shifted loops:0(NA%)

Creating DGEList object...
   ✓ DGEList created
   - Samples: ctrl, mut 
   - Library sizes: ctrl = 10789577 , mut = 10377560 
   - Ratio (ctrl/mut): 1.04 

Filtering low-count loops...
   - Filtering with min.count = 5 
   - Before filtering: 22108 loops
   - Loops passing filter: 22104 
   - Loops filtered out:4(0%)
   After filtering: 22104 loops retained
   - New library sizes: ctrl = 10789575 , mut = 10377558 

Performing TMM normalization...
   ✓ Normalization complete
   - Method: TMM 
   - Normalization factors: ctrl = 1.006 , mut = 0.994 
   - Effective library sizes: ctrl = 10854740 , mut = 10315258 

Running differential analysis with multiple dispersions...
   (No biological replicates: using fixed BCV values)

   Analysis with BCV = 0.1 ( lower bound)
      - Dispersion = 0.01 
      ✓ Significant loops (FDR < 0.05): 40 
        - Up in mutant: 31 
        - Down in mutant: 9 
        - Strong (|logFC| > 1): 33 
        - Moderate (|logFC| > 0.5): 7 

   Analysis with BCV = 0.15 ( primary bound)
      - Dispersion = 0.0225 
      ✓ Significant loops (FDR < 0.05): 2 
        - Up in mutant: 1 
        - Down in mutant: 1 
        - Strong (|logFC| > 1): 2 
        - Moderate (|logFC| > 0.5): 0 

   Analysis with BCV = 0.2 ( upper bound)
      - Dispersion = 0.04 
      ✓ Significant loops (FDR < 0.05): 1 
        - Up in mutant: 1
